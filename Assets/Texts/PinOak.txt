The Pin Oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh) is recognized for the unique pin-like shape of its lower branches and its deeply lobed leaves. Though not native to Canada, it has been cultivated in urban and suburban areas for its aesthetic appeal. In Kelowna the Pin Oak trees enhance local landscapes, providing shade and attracting birds with their acorns. Fun fact: The Pin Oak's acorns are an essential food source for various birds and small mammals, contributing to the region's ecological balance.
