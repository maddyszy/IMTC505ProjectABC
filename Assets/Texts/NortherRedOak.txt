The Northern Red Oak (Quercus rubra) stands tall in the Canadian forests, displaying its distinct lobed leaves and acorns. Specifically, the Northern Red Oak is native to Ontario.  While not as common as some other oak species in Canada, it holds its own significance. Indigenous peoples historically used its bark for medicinal purposes, and its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it ideal for furniture and construction. In the Kelowna/Okanagan region, the Northern Red Oak enriches local urban centres with its biodiversity, supporting various wildlife including small mammals and birds. Fun fact: Northern Red Oak leaves can turn brilliant shades of red and russet in the fall, adding to the autumnal beauty of the region.
