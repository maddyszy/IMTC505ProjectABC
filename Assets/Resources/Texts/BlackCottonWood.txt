The Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) is a native tree in western North America, including parts of British Columbia. It is renowned for its rapid growth and towering height, making it one of the largest deciduous trees in North America. In Canada, Black Cottonwoods thrive near rivers and streams, playing a crucial role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitats for various species. In the Okanagan region, these trees contribute to the region's riparian ecosystems, supporting a rich diversity of plant and animal life. Fun fact: Black Cottonwood leaves and buds contain a resinous substance with a pleasant, balsam-like aroma, hence the tree's name.
