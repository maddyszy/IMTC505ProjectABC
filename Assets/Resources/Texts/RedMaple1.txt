The Red Maple, scientifically known as Acer rubrum, is a prominent symbol of Canada's natural beauty and is often associated with the country's vibrant autumn foliage. This iconic tree is widely distributed throughout Canada, including the Okanagan region. Its distinctive red leaves in the fall represent the nation's changing seasons, symbolizing resilience and adaptability. In the local Okanagan region, the Red Maple's presence adds to the region's diverse and colourful landscape. Fun fact: Red Maple sap can be used to make maple syrup, although it typically has a lower sugar content than sugar maple sap.
