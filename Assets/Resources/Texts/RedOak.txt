The Red Oak (Quercus rubra) is a widespread tree species in North America, including parts of Canada. It is native to Central and Southern Ontario and can be found east of Lake Superior. Its leaves feature pointed lobes and a vibrant red hue in the fall, making it a standout tree in the Canadian wilderness. Red Oaks are essential for their hardwood, used in crafting furniture, flooring, and architectural elements. In the Okanagan region, Red Oak trees enrich the local environment, supporting diverse ecosystems. Fun fact: Red Oak trees can produce acorns as early as 20 years old, providing a vital food source for wildlife such as squirrels and deer.
