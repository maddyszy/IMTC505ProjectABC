The Crab Apple Tree, or scientifically known as Malus, is known for its ornamental value and small, edible apples. While not native to Canada, it has found its place in gardens and landscapes, including those around UBC Okanagan. The tree is admired for its profusion of fragrant blossoms in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. In Canada, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, showcasing its vibrant blooms even in colder climates. Fun fact: Crab apples can vary in size, colour, and flavour, with some varieties suitable for making jams, jellies, and even cider.
